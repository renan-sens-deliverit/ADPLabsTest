As requested, a WebApi was created that just by calling the Get CalcTask function, another call to the ADP API occurs inside, which results in a task to be calculated and the result checked in another post in another ADP API, where having checked with success, code 200 will be returned and an object containing the values, the operation performed, and the final result. In case of any error, the return will be different from 200 and the object will return null.
It was assigned the generation of logs and recording in memory of objects of received tasks, and of sent results, as suggested.
